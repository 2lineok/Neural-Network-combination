Recent advancements in neural networks have led to the development of various innovative architectures designed to approximate complex operators. These structures are increasingly being explored for their potential to enhance the performance and efficiency of machine learning models across a wide range of applications.

One of the novel architectures emerging from this trend is the Deep Operator Network, commonly known as Deep O Net. This method excels at approximating complex operators by leveraging a more flexible approach to weight representation. Unlike traditional neural networks, which often have fixed structures and weight constraints, Deep O Net allows for greater adaptability in how weights are handled, enabling the model to capture more intricate patterns and relationships within the data. This flexibility makes Deep O Net particularly effective in scenarios where the operator being approximated is highly nonlinear or where traditional methods may struggle to achieve high accuracy. By providing more freedom in the weight information, Deep O Net enhances the ability of neural networks to generalize across different tasks, leading to improved performance in various applications such as computational physics, fluid dynamics, and other fields requiring precise operator approximations.
