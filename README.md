Try to use Deep O Net for image classification

Researchers at Brown University recently developed DeepONet, a new neural network-based model that can learn both linear and nonlinear operators. Our setting is to solve equeation. For example $\triangle u(x)=u(x)^2$, $x \in R$. One of most benefit of this method is we can include
